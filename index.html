There are many estimates on for the number of lives lost ranging from 1,300 to nearly 1,900. The commonly held number is 1,833, though many have disputed this number in recent years. </p> <br> <p> In 2008, the Department of Health and Hospitals in Louisiana published a report that determined an upper-bound estimate of 1,400 lives lost. The same study found that of the confirmed 971 victims in Louisiana 53% were men, and 51% were African American. It's believed that over half of all fatalities were victims of 74 years and older. </p> <br> </div> <div class=container> <p> <b>Fatalities by Age and Race</b> (DHH)</p> <p></p> <div id=human-age-chart></div> </div> </div> <div class=section id=section-pop-map> <div class=text> <h3 class=text-large>Population Displaced</h3> <p> According to U.S. Census "intercensal estimates", only seven counties in the United States saw a loss of both >3% of their population and >3,000 people between 2005 and 2006. All seven of these counties are located along the Gulf Coast and took a direct hit from hurricane Katrina. Three of the counties were in Mississippi (Hancock, Harison, and Jackson Counties) while four were in Louisiana ( St. Bernard, Orleans, Plaquemines, and Jefferson Parishes). </p> <br> </div> <div id=pop-images class="images-container container"> <div class=image-holder><img src=kat-five/images/aerial.jpg></div> <div class=image-holder><img src=kat-five/images/superdome.jpg></div> <div class=image-holder><img src=kat-five/images/trailers.jpg></div> </div> <div class=text> <br> <p> Over 1 million people were displaced from their homes due to hurricane, some for just a few days, and many others for weeks, months, and even years.
