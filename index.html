First slamming Florida on August 25th, 2005 as a category 1 hurricane, the cyclone would move into the Gulf of Mexico and strengthen before making a second landfall as a category 3 hurricane in Louisiana on the morning of August, 29th, 2005. </p> <br> <p> Prior to making landfall in New Orleans, Katrina strengthened into a category 5 hurricane as it moved across the heart of the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, reaching maximum sustained winds of 175mph on August 28th. Evacuation orders went out to an estimated 1 million people along the Gulf Coast, as Katrina set sights on the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline. </p> <br> <p> It is estimated that nearly 100,000 people remained in New Orleans during the storm, either by choice or otherwise. Those that stayed behind braved the storm in their homes and various shelters across the city, with nearly 10,000 people hunkering down in the New Orleans' Superdome. Katrina displaced the greatest number of individuals in the United States since the Dust Bowl. </p> </div> </div> <div class=section id=section-track-map> <div class=text> <h3 class=text-large style=display:none>Hurricane Track</h3> </div> <div id=katrina-track-map> <div id=animate-track>Animate Track</div> <div id=track-map-legend class=container> <div id=track-map-legend-inner> <div><b>Hurricane Katrina Track and Wind Speed</b> (NOAA)</div> <div class=swatch-container> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#b10026></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#e31a1c></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#fc4e2a></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#fd8d3c></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#feb24c></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#fed976></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#ffeda0></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#ffffcc></div> </div> <div class=legend-vals> <div class=legend-min>&lt;30kt</div> <div class=legend-max>&gt;140kt</div> </div> </div> </div> <div id=track-infowin></div> <div id=map-overlay></div> </div> </div> <div class=section id=section-from-space> <div class=text> <h3 class=text-large>Eye from the Sky</h3> <p> Little in (or out of) this world holds the same tremendous impact as seeing a tropical cyclone from space.

There are many estimates on for the number of lives lost ranging from 1,300 to nearly 1,900. The commonly held number is 1,833, though many have disputed this number in recent years. </p> <br> <p> In 2008, the Department of Health and Hospitals in Louisiana published a report that determined an upper-bound estimate of 1,400 lives lost. The same study found that of the confirmed 971 victims in Louisiana 53% were men, and 51% were African American. Over half of all fatalities were victims of 74 years and older. </p> <br> </div> <div class=container> <p> <b>Fatalities by Age and Race</b> (DHH)</p> <p></p> <div id=human-age-chart></div> </div> </div> <div class=section id=section-pop-map> <div class=text> <h3 class=text-large>Population Displaced</h3> <p> For those fleeing the storm the journey was only beginning when Katrina made landfall the morning of August 29th. The dramatic shift in population would have a ripple effect across the country, as hundreds of thousands of people left home not knowing if they would ever return. </p> <br> <p> According to U.S. Census intercensal estimates, only seven counties in the United States saw a loss of both >3% of their population and >3,000 people between 2005 and 2006. All seven of these counties are located along the Gulf Coast and took a direct hit from hurricane Katrina. Three of the counties were in Mississippi (Hancock, Harison, and Jackson Counties) while four were in Louisiana (St. Bernard, Orleans, Plaquemines, and Jefferson Parishes). </p> <br> </div> <div id=pop-images class="images-container container"> <div class=image-holder><img src=images/aerial.jpg></div> <div class=image-holder><img src=images/superdome.jpg></div> <div class=image-holder><img src=images/trailers.jpg></div> </div> <div class=text> <br> <p> Over 1 million people were displaced from their homes due to hurricane, some for just a few days, and many others for weeks, months, and even years. According to census estimates, Orleans Parish saw the greatest number of people displaced from 2005 to 2006, with <b>264,122 fewer people estimated to live in the parish the year following Katrina</b>. Meanwhile, St. Bernard Parish saw the greatest percentage of its population decrease, with <b>77% fewer people</b> living in the parish in 2006 compared to 2005. </p> <br> <p> In total, these seven counties saw a decrease of 392,516 people the year following Katrina, or nearly that of the estimated population of the city of Cleveland, Ohio in 2014. </p> <br> </div> <div id=county-map-legend class=container> <div><b>Population change 2005 - 2006 greater than 3% and total pop > 5,000</b> (U.S. Census)</div> <div class=swatch-container> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#d94701></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#fd8d3c></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#fdbe85></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#feedde></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#eff3ff></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#bdd7e7></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#6baed6></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#2171b5></div> </div> <div class=legend-vals> <div class=legend-min>&lt;-75%</div> <div class=legend-max>&gt;75%</div> </div> </div> <div id=county-map></div> <div id=pop-change-list class=container> <div class=table-responsive> <table class=table> <caption>County Intercensal Estimates | Comparing 2005 and 2006 populations</caption> <thead> <tr> <th>State</th> <th>County/Parish</th> <th>Pre Katrina Pop (2005)</th> <th>Post Katrina Pop (2006)</th> <th>Population Change</th> <th>Percent Change</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Louisiana</td> <td>St. Bernard Parish</td> <td>71,300</td> <td>16,563</td> <td>-54,737</td> <td style="background:rgba(238, 48, 0, 0.1); color:#000"><b>-77%</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Louisiana</td> <td>Orleans Parish</td> <td>494,294</td> <td>230,172</td> <td style="background:rgba(238, 48, 0, 0.1); color:#000"><b>-264,122</b></td> <td>-54%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Louisiana</td> <td>Plaquemines Parish</td> <td>29,558</td> <td>22,329</td> <td>-7,229</td> <td>-25%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mississippi</td> <td>Hancock County</td> <td>47,715</td> <td>40,087</td> <td>-7,628</td> <td>-16%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mississippi</td> <td>Harison County</td> <td>197,784</td> <td>174,449</td> <td>-23,335</td> <td>-12%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Louisiana</td> <td>Jefferson Parish</td> <td>456,554</td> <td>426,285</td> <td>-30,269</td> <td>-8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mississippi</td> <td>Jackson County</td> <td>137,913</td> <td>132,717</td> <td>-5,196</td> <td>-4%</td> </tr> <tr class=info> <td>Totals: </td> <td> </td> <td><b>1,435,118</b></td> <td><b>1,042,602</b></td> <td><b>-392,516</b></td> <td><b>-28%</b></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div class=text> <br> <br> <p> Today, the population of New Orleans remains below pre-Katrina numbers, having only recovered about 57% of the population that left between 2005 and 2006.

It's estimated that up to 80% of the metro New Orleans area saw flooding from Katrina and the failed levees. </p> <br> <p> <b>TODO CHECK THIS AND EXPAND ON</b>The breached levees have now been rebuilt, with an estimated price tag of <b>$14.3 billion</b>. </p> <br> <iframe src=http://www.npr.org/player/embed/5418521/5419261 width=100% height=290 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe> <br> <b>Over 350,000 homes destroyed</b> <p> For many the option to return home has never been there, or the idea of rebuilding was simply too daunting a task. According to FEMA, <b>352,930 homes</b> were destroyed across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, with an additional 139,376 homes sustaining "major" damage. Sandy is the only storm on record to hit the United States and cause similar destruction to homes, with other notable hurricanes causing far less destruction to homes. </p> <br> <p> Ten years later the The University of New Orleans Department of Geography estimates 81% of the homes in Orleans and St. Bernard parishes have been rebuilt, with 15% of the homes being raised and never rebuilt. </p> <br> <b>Homes damaged or destroyed in Katrina compared to other memorable storms:</b> </div> <div id=homes-chart class=container></div> </div> <div class=section id=section-lessons-learned> <div class=text> <h3 class=text-large>Ten Years Later</h3> <p> Needless to say, the road to recover has been a slow one for the region. Metropolitan New Orleans saw a labor force of ~550,000 pre-Katrina drop to 479,129 the year following the storm, and an unemployment rate jump from 5.9% to 15% in the wake of Katrina. Today unemployment in the region remains high, but nowhere near those months following the storm, while the labor force continues to steadily grow, with the latest estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimating a labor force of 613,639 as of June, 2015. </p> <br> </div> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" id=unemployment-rate></div> <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" id=labor-force></div> </div> </div> <div class=text> <br> <p> As we reflect this week on what this historic natural disaster, we remember the lives lost and lives forever changed 10 years ago today. Through much criticism and hardship there has been areas of great recovery over the last decade, but still plenty of work to do. While the United States has been spared in recent years from direct hits from major hurricane (category 3 or greater), this surely won't last forever. </p> <br> <b>Major drought for major hurricane U.S. landfalls</b> <p> Hurricane Wilma of 2005 was the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/04/30/whats-driving-our-major-hurricane-landfall-drought-study-says-its-just-dumb-luck/">last major hurricane</a> to make landfall in the United States. While historical accounts are a bit muddied, this is the longest stretch on record without a major landfall. All of the landfalls in the map below occurred either in 2004 (Ivan, Charley, Jeanne) or 2005 (Rita, Katrina, Dennis, Wilma). This drought will certainly come to an end, likely sooner than later, and when it does let us hope we remember some lessons learned from Katrina, and survive the category 5 <a href="http://www.weather5280.com/blog/2014/07/01/online-weather-world-should-take-a-chill-pill-before-disaster-strikes/">media storm</a> that will be covering a major hurricane landfall. </p> <br> </div> <div id=major-map-legend class=container> <div><b>Major hurricane U.S. landfalls 2000 - 2014</b></div> <div class=swatch-container> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#3498db></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#f1c40f></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#f39c12></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#e67e22></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#d35400></div> <div class=legend-swatch style=background:#c0392b></div> </div> <div class=legend-vals> <div class=legend-min>TS</div> <div class=legend-max>Cat 5</div> </div> </div> <div id=major-canes-map></div> <div class=text> <br> <p> Needs a final closing paragraph here! <b>TODO</b> </p> <br> </div> </div> <ul> <li>infrastructure (then and now)</li> <li>economy</li> <li>highlight total cost of Katrina somewhere....</li> <li>animated satellite</li> <li>something more about flooding?</li> <li>flood extent / depth map</li> <li>add hurricane track to pop displacement map</li> <li>closing section: it could happen again, crazy that this happened, U.S. in exceptional hurricane "drought" (show stats)</li> <li>MAKE A TWITTER CARD (see ghost)</li> <li>Add DISQUS!</li> <li>talk about fema, gov, walmart?</li> <li>add my byline!</li> </ul>  <script>
